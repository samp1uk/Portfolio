# Portfolio
Computer Information Systems Portfolio
This repository contains work from a variety of CIS classes that I completed as part of my coursework at the University of Louisville. Samples from a variety of classes have been chosen to best reflect the breadth of the coursework in the program. I have divided this portfolio into several sections: Business Analysis, Database Design, Information Security, Software Development, Systems Analysis and Design, and Web Development.

Business Analysis
This folder contains coursework from the CIS capstone course at UofL. This work explores the strategic development of information technology as well as the application of ethics in business, as seen through the lens of "case studies", which present problems reflected by both real and fictional businesses.

Database Design
This folder contains coursework from the CIS Database Design course at UofL. This work explores the use and interpretation of data structures as seen in real IT environments. Coursework involves both the interpretation and analysis of data structures and the relationships within, as well as a range of general SQL skills needed to perform complex queries.

Information Security
This folder contains coursework from the CIS Introduction to Information Security Course at UofL. This work explores, in broad strokes, the basics necessary in understanding Information Security and its importance in the workplace. The Coursework itself is simply a reflection of the major topics discussed throughout the course, which culminates to a brief security analysis I conducted for Brick Bridge Consulting.

Resume
This folder contains an up-to-date downloadable resume.

Software Development
This folder contains coursework from both the Introductory and Intermediate CIS Software Development Courses at UofL. The coursework helps project a timeline of growth from my first time using Visual Studio, all the way up to more advanced programming topics and assignments using C# .NET.

Systems Analysis and Design
This folder contains the entirety of the cousework from the CIS Systems Analysis and Design course at UofL. The coursework is based around a group IT project for a real-life client. More specifically, this course involved the PLAN and DEVELOPMENT stages of the Agile Software Lifecycle.

Web Development
This folder contains the coursework from the CIS Development Project course at UofL. In this course, I executed the DEVELOPMENT phase of the project for the work that began in the Systems Analysis and Design course. The work within is a direct copy of the original GitHub repository used when developing the website for the client.
